# Design — separating the plan, the money, and the calendar

**Status:** Written 2026-07-26. **Every phase is built** (2026-07-26) — the ledger, bank
reconciliation, `actual = Σ ledger`, the calendar split out into `state.events[]`, attendance as a
head count, per-head pricing with `fundedBy`/`paidDirectTo`, charges with all four settlement
paths, and the 510-278 categories with a derived funding summary. What remains is the open
decisions in §7 (9, 11) and whatever the pack learns from a season of using it.
**Problem:** budgeting and spending are the same record, so neither can be done properly.

> **Naming note.** `state.ledger` is the transaction register described in §3.3. The word
> "ledger" used to mean *the saved pack document* throughout `index.html` (`subscribeLedger`,
> "the shared ledger"); that usage was renamed to **"the pack record"** / `subscribeDoc` when
> Phase 0 landed, so the word now means one thing. The localStorage key
> `pack-popcorn-ledger-v1` keeps its old name — it addresses data already in every leader's
> browser and must never change.

## 0. Audit, 2026-07-26

Everything above was built and then audited. The audit found **five defects that the
phase-by-phase tests missed**, all of the same family: a record outliving the thing it
belonged to.

| Defect | Effect |
|---|---|
| `rolloverYear` never cleared `state.charges` | A waived or forgiven charge survived the year-end pointing at a deleted line. The new year opened reporting last year's forgiveness against a "Removed line", and every Dues total was wrong. |
| Deleting a budget line orphaned its charges | `syncCharges` keeps settled rows *on purpose*, so a forgiven charge outlived the line for good. Now the charges go with the line and come back on Undo. |
| Removing a scout orphaned their charges | A settled charge sat in the totals against a family no longer on the roster. Their charges now go; their ledger entries stay (that money really moved) but stop pointing at a scout who does not exist. |
| An `income`-category line raised charges | Filing dues under "Income" — a plausible mistake — counted the same money twice in B, once as fees owed and once as a budgeted income line. |
| `rolloverYear` dropped `category` | `freshLine` defaults to `other`, so the whole 510-278 grouping silently reset every year — and an income line came back as an ordinary expense that bills families. |

The common cause is worth recording: **`syncCharges` deliberately refuses to delete a settled
charge**, which is right — a book does not lose rows because somebody corrected a head count.
But that makes every *deliberate* deletion (a line, a scout, a year) responsible for its own
cascade, and four of the five defects were a missing cascade.

Also removed: five functions and constants written during the phases and never called
(`budgetLineName`, `lineRateFor`, `lineFundingLabel`, `HEAD_KINDS`, `LINE_CATEGORY_LABELS`).

Tests went 137 → 143. The gap they had in common: they asserted that each phase's *new* code
was right, and never that the *old* code around it had been taught about the new records.

### The same defect from the other side, 2026-07-27

The audit fixed what deleting a budget line does to the *records*. It did not ask whether the
delete should have been that easy to trigger: the ✕ sat inches from Options on a crowded row,
took a **single tap**, and offered a six-second Undo toast as the only way back. A pack lost
planned activities to a mis-tap and had no idea what had gone.

Both budget deletes now open a dialog that says **what goes** (the planned figure, the charges
and their value) and **what stays** (ledger entries — money that moved does not un-move; the
calendar entry, which is what makes the line re-addable). The Undo toast is kept as well, and
removal happens in one function shared by both halves of the budget, because two copies of that
cascade is exactly how the audit's second defect happened.

The other half of the fix is a way back that does not depend on knowing where to look: the
Budget lists **activities on the calendar with no budget line**, each with one tap to add it
back onto the event it already has. A free hike belongs in that list too — which is the point.
It is a *state*, not an error, so a deleted line is no longer indistinguishable from a plan
nobody ever made.

### Multi-year scenario, 2026-07-26

`test/scenario-browser.js` drives the real app through **three program years** and
cross-checks every figure against arithmetic computed inside the scenario itself — never
against the app's own functions, so the two cannot agree by sharing a bug. **62 checks, 0
failures.**

It is the counterpart to `test/harness.mjs`: that file tests functions in isolation, this one
tests what happens to a pack's books over *time*, across two close-outs. That is exactly where
the five audit defects lived, and none of them were reachable by a unit test.

The year-1 arc it verifies, end to end: a $3,450 plan against $2,320 of income gives a $1,130
fundraising need and a **derived** $3,531.25 pack goal ($353.13 a scout); $1,450 of council
camp stays out of both A and B; 26 heads at the campout raise $940 in charges and 26 at Blue &
Gold raise $355, against $800 of roster-based dues; a $300 tier waives three scouts' dues
($240) and not one head they brought; one charge is forgiven, one family is covered by a
donation, and one family ends the year genuinely owing $190; the books reconcile to the
statement at $0.00 difference and close with the archive holding the campout's real $1,020
rather than an estimate.

Then it proves the year boundary holds: carryover is the reconciled bank balance to the cent,
categories and per-head rates and `paidDirectTo` all survive, flat lines re-seed from what they
actually cost, every activity comes back scheduled, nothing settled leaks into the new year,
and after a second close-out both archives still hold their own numbers with the bank chaining
$420 → $372.50 → $272.50 unbroken.

### Treasurer's audit, 2026-09-27

A treasurer walked the books end to end and found the same family of defect again — records
outliving, or being counted beside, the thing they belonged to. What changed, item by item:

- **Commission was counted twice (M1).** §3.6 tells the treasurer to post the council's cheque
  to a "Popcorn income" line. `lineActualCents` read any money in without a scout as a *vendor
  refund*, so the posted commission came off Actual spent while Funds in was already counting
  the same commission from sales. Now an entry whose `source` names it as income (commission,
  fundraiser, donation, family, carryover) is never a refund (`entryIsRefund`), and income-
  category lines are in **neither planned nor actual spending** — they were already in B, not
  A, on the worksheet, so the Budget card's Planned read higher than A by every planned income
  dollar. What an income line brought in reaches **Funds in** instead (`ledgerIncomeCents`).
  **The posted commission replaces the sales-derived estimate** as soon as any entry with
  `source: 'commission'` exists — that is what §3.3 always intended ("posted once, on the day
  the council cheque clears — which is when it's actually true"). Until then the estimate is
  the best figure there is, and the Budget card says which one it is showing.
- **Carryover was the projection (M2).** `rolloverYear` opened the new ledger at the closing
  bank balance but set the Budget's *Starting funds* to `bud.balance` — the projection. Two
  carryovers, and the Budget's was the guess. Now both are the bank balance whenever the closing
  year had a ledger **with an opening figure** (`closingCarryover`). A ledger with no opening
  date only knows net movement, which is not a balance, so that pack keeps the projection and
  its new book is left unopened (the "Start from the carryover figure" button is right there).
- **Year two waived nothing (M3).** The rollover rebuilds every line through `freshLine`, which
  mints a new id, while each reward tier's `covers` kept last year's ids — so the tiers still
  *listed* what they covered and matched no charge at all. Every cover key (bare, `act:`, and
  `#adult`/`#sibling` shares) is now re-pointed through an old → new id map (`remapCoverKey`).
  A tier's `dueBy` moves **forward one year** (`shiftISOYear`) rather than being cleared: a
  carried-over deadline has passed, so every tier with one opened the year closed and billed
  everybody, and clearing it would silently turn a hard deadline into none. The Kernel should
  still check the new date — the council's own deadline moves a little each year.
- **A make-up payment was spent twice (M5).** A family paying the difference to reach a tier
  writes a ledger entry carrying the scout and the tier (`tierMakeup`). The tier then waives the
  fee — and `paymentsForScout` *also* counted the same money against the family's other charges.
  A treasurer reproduced a family shown owing $10 that really owed $40. Make-up entries no longer
  settle charges (`entryPaysCharges`); `chargeTotals` reports them as `makeup`, the Dues card
  says so on its own line instead of inside *Received*, and they still reach Funds in.
- **Editing a reimbursement un-paid it (M6).** A reimbursement is money *out* carrying the scout
  it paid back, and that scout is how `tierReimbursements` knows it is done. The ledger editor
  cleared `scoutId` on every edit of a money-out entry — including typing the receipt number the
  reimburse toast asks for. Now only flipping the direction clears it; the entry's detail row says
  who it was paid back to.
- **Balances were per scout, not per family (M7).** §3.4 has always said *"Outstanding for a
  family"*, and the code worked it out per scout. One cheque for two siblings, recorded against
  the elder, left the elder silently in credit (floored to "square") and the younger still owing
  everything. Balances are now per **family** — `familyAccounts(charges, ledger, keyOf)`, keyed by
  `chargeFamilyKey`, which is `familyKeyOf` read through `getScout` so an archived child still
  pools with the siblings left behind. A family that has overpaid shows **Credit $X** instead of
  "square". The Dues card is one block per household, titled *Family balances*, and "Square"
  counts families. Every "owes $X" beside a scout's name, the Treasurer's Home nag, and the amount
  prefilled by *Record a payment* all mean the household now.
- **A former scout's balance had no row (M9).** *Still owed* counted every charge, and the list
  under it showed only the current roster, so a crossed-over Webelos's unpaid campout was in the
  total with nowhere to pay or forgive it. Families with nobody left on the roster and an account
  that is not square now get their own card, *Former scouts with a balance*, with the same
  controls as everyone else.
- **One payment froze every charge (M8).** `syncCharges` refused to drop or re-price a charge
  if the *scout* had paid anything at all, so a dues cheque froze the campout: a head count
  corrected afterwards could not remove the parent who never came. Payments are now **allocated**
  to charges (`chargePaidAllocation`) — a payment posted against a line pays that family's open
  charges on the line first, the rest pays oldest first — and only a charge with money allocated
  to it is kept or frozen. Derived every time, never stored: no `chargeId` on ledger entries, so
  no migration and nothing to drift. And a per-family fee's scout charge is matched **by family**
  (`chargeMatchKey`), so when the Arrow of Light scout carrying it crosses over and billing moves
  to a sibling, the family keeps the charge it has instead of being billed a second time.
- **Close-out erased what families owed (M4).** The 2026-07-26 audit made `rolloverYear` clear
  `state.charges`, which was right about the *charges* — they belong to the year that raised them
  and point at lines that no longer exist — and wrong about the *balances*. A family's unpaid $45
  disappeared everywhere but the archive. Now each family's net open balance is read before
  anything is cleared and comes forward as **one charge on no line**, labelled *Prior-year
  balance (2026–27)*; `syncCharges` keeps line-less charges, since nothing raises them.
  Crossed-over and archived scouts' families come forward too, under *Former scouts with a
  balance*. A family **in credit** comes forward as a `carryover` payment dated the day before the
  new book opens — in the family's account, not in the bank twice (decision 12). (This first
  required an opening date and dropped credits without one; see T3 below.)
  A carried credit settles charges but is reported as *Carried forward*, not *Received*, and stays
  out of Funds in — it is already inside the carryover. A former family whose balance was
  **forgiven** stays listed, so the decision can be read and undone.
- **Reconciliation could agree with the wrong statement (M10).** *Tick all* ticked every entry
  since the opening date and `reconcileTotals` counted every ticked one, so an October cheque
  could move a September statement. Both now stop at the **statement date** (`entryOnStatement`);
  later entries are listed as waiting for the next statement. A **reconciled entry is read-only**
  in the ledger — no field edits, no delete — until an explicit two-tap *Un-reconcile*.
  **Forgiving a charge now requires both a reason and who agreed it**, and **undoing** a
  forgiveness appends a line to the charge's `note` (who forgave it, when, why, and when it was
  undone) instead of erasing it. Decision 11 (who may forgive) is still open; this does not gate
  it by job.
- **The family-cost quote left out registration (M11).** `freshLine` defaults `fundedBy` to
  `pack`, so the seeded *Youth registration* line was pack-paid and `familyYearCostForDen` — which
  only counts what families pay — left the year's biggest single fee out of every quote. New packs
  now seed it **families pay**. An existing pack's line is never changed (the seed only adds a
  missing line); instead the leader card says, by name, when the pack pays national registration
  and so it is not in the figure. Both cards stop calling the figure *"the most a family can be
  asked for"* — it is the **typical cost for one scout and one parent** — and list what is not
  included: a second parent, siblings, flat family-paid lines (named on the leader card), and the
  council program fee or registration when the budget has no line for them. The parent card's
  wording changed; what `buildParentView` publishes did not.
- **Past seasons read the wrong months.** Archived activity slots were never rebased when the
  program year moved to a July start — correctly, an archive is a record — but `seasonSlotLabel`
  applied the July month names with the September year-turn, so a new archive's December read as
  the next year and an old archive's September read as July. New archives carry
  `slotBase: 'july'`; one without it is September-based if it was closed before 2026-07-27.
- **Budget vs actual by category (E9).** §3.6 promised the committee *"budget-vs-actual by
  category, with variance, straight off the plan"* and nothing showed it. The Budget workspace now
  has a card under *Pack budget*: planned, actual and variance per 510-278 category and in total,
  over-budget in red. Same rules as `computeBudget` — income lines are not spending, and a
  paid-direct line is out of the plan but its reimbursements are in actual (`budgetVsActual`).

### Treasurer's review of those fixes, 2026-09-28

The treasurer re-read the fixes above against the books (verdict: OK with changes). What changed:

- **A refunded credit never left the account (T1).** The Dues card told the treasurer to
  "record the refund as money out", and money out could not name a family — so the credit stayed
  on the account after the cheque went, and at close-out came forward as a carryover payment: the
  family was paid back twice. Money out can now carry a family as a **refund**
  (`source: 'refund'`, `entryRefundsFamily`); the Dues block has *Record a refund…* beside a
  credit, and the ledger has a *Refunded to* picker on money out. `familyAccounts`,
  `familyOutstanding` and `chargePaidAllocation` take a refund off what the family paid — off
  their unallocated credit first, and only past that off the newest charge. `chargeTotals`
  reports it as `refunded`, Funds in loses it, and it is not a cost of any line it sits on. A
  reward-tier **reimbursement** is also money out carrying a scout, and is not a refund: it is
  now marked `reimbursement: true`, and one recorded before the mark has no source, so it can
  never read as one. `tierReimbursements` ignores refunds.
- **The close-out preview promised the projection (T2).** It still said the starting balance
  becomes "this year's ending balance" and showed the Budget's projection, when since M2 a book
  with an opening date carries its bank balance. It now shows
  `closingCarryover(projection, bookBalance(), bank known)` — the figure `rolloverYear` will
  carry, decided the same way — and says whether that is the bank balance or the projection.
- **Credits vanished without an opening date, and said nothing (T3).** M4 carried a family's
  credit only when the closing book had an opening date, so a pack that never set one lost every
  credit at close-out with nothing on screen. The credit now always comes forward, dated the day
  before the program year starts — which is where *Start from the carryover figure* opens the
  book, so once that pack sets its opening balance the credit is already before it. Until then it
  sits in the ledger's net movement, which is not a bank balance anyway, and it is never Funds in.
  The close-out preview now has a *Family accounts* line (`closeoutFamilyLine`): "N families'
  unpaid balances ($X) come forward as Prior-year balance; M families' credits ($Y) come forward."
  It no longer lists the dues among what is cleared; it says the year's charges and ledger entries
  are.
- **An old commission cheque could still be counted twice (T4).** A cheque posted before M1 to an
  income line with a blank or "fundraiser" source is counted in Funds in as other income, while
  the sales estimate — still in use, since no entry says `commission` — is counted too. The app
  does not guess from the description: while the estimate is in use, the Budget card lists each
  income line with such money in (`commissionLookalikes`: source blank, fundraiser or other) and
  asks "Is this the council's commission cheque? Set its source to Popcorn commission so it isn't
  counted twice." And a **$0** commission entry no longer counts as posted — it used to switch
  the estimate off and leave commission at nothing.
- **The carryover could be counted twice (T5).** A money-in entry with source *Carryover* and
  no family, filed to a line, reached Funds in as other income — on top of Starting funds, which
  is the same money. `ledgerIncomeCents` now skips it. (A family's carried credit has a scout and
  was already reported as *Carried forward*, never Funds in.)
- **A part-paid commission (T6).** When the posted commission is less than sales work out to,
  the Funds in line adds "— $Y still expected from the council". Funds in still counts only what
  has arrived.
- **Totals on part of the book (T7).** `chargeTotals` reads its payment figures off the whole
  ledger and a family's outstanding off its whole account, so handed one line's charges it
  reported every payment in the pack as paid for that line. Nothing displayed those figures for a
  subset, but three callers passed one. The charge-only figures (raised, standing, waived,
  forgiven) are now `chargeSetTotals(charges)`, which the subset callers use, and `chargeTotals`
  is documented — and tested — as whole-book only. Per-charge payment is `chargePaidAllocation`,
  which needs every charge to answer.

## 1. The problem, concretely

One record does three unrelated jobs:

```js
activity = { id, slot, date, time, endTime, location, note, sourceUid,  // a calendar event
             estCents, actualCents,                                      // a budget line
             perScout, familyPays }                                      // a billing rule
```

`state.budget.activities` is read by **14 functions, and half of them are calendar code**:

| Calendar readers | Money readers |
|---|---|
| `dayEventsForMonth` · `nextUpEvents` · `monthAgendaCard` · `renderCalendarTab` · `buildICS` · `monthlyDigest` · `buildParentView` | `renderBudget` · `computeBudget` · `homeTasks` · `packFlow` · `seedStandardYear` · `activitiesInSlot` · `buildSeasonArchive` |

That single fact is the whole design problem. An activity is two records that happen to share a row.

### What it costs us today

| Symptom | Root cause |
|---|---|
| Importing a BAND calendar writes **budget rows** | event and budget line are one record |
| `$42 actual × 10 scouts` even if 6 attended | `actualCents` is a *rate*, not a transaction |
| Can't record two receipts against one line | one `actualCents` field per line |
| Can't reconcile to the bank statement | **there are no transactions at all** |
| Reward-tier coverage needed special-casing inside `computeBudget` | no family-account layer to credit |
| "Is this line per-scout?" answers three questions at once | `perScout` = unit of measure *and* who owes *and* (proposed) attendance |

`bud.balance` is a **model output**, not a reconciled cash position. It is computed as
`startingBalance + commission + retainedCash + feesCollected + otherFundraisers − actual`.
Every term is derived from another subsystem. Nothing in the app can be checked against a bank
statement, which is what a treasurer is actually accountable for.

---

## 2. What Scouting America actually prescribes

**The budget worksheet is planning only.** The [Pack Operating Budget (510-278)](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/510-278_wb.pdf)
is every line as `cost per person × number of people = total`, in fixed categories, totalling to:

```
A) Total budgeted program expenses
B) Income subtotal  (annual dues · prior-year surplus · other parent payments)
C) Total fundraising need = A − B      →  C ÷ commission% = pack popcorn goal
                                          (the LOWER of the pack’s two rates — see below)
                                       →  pack goal ÷ scouts = per-scout goal
```

There is **no "actual spent" column anywhere on it.**

#### Two commission rates, one goal

*Owner ask, 2026-07-27.* Trail's End does not pay one rate: online direct sales usually earn more
than storefront and wagon, because there is no product to buy and no shift to staff. So the
commissionable money is **split by channel** and each half earns its own rate, rounded separately —
the pack is paid on each, and rounding a blended figure once would be a cent out for no reason.
Cash donations ride with storefront and wagon: they are handed over in person whatever the online
rate is.

`commissionPctOnline` blank means **"the same as the main rate"**, which is what every pack record
meant before the field existed, so nothing moves until a second figure is typed.

The derived **goal** is worked out at the **lower of the two rates**, whichever channel that turns
out to be.

> *Corrected 2026-07-27, same day.* This first said "the storefront/wagon rate, because online earns
> more". Pack 569's rates are **35% storefront, 30% online** — the other way round from the usual
> assumption — and at those rates a goal derived from 35% is short by 5% of every dollar that comes
> in online. A minimum must never be wrong in that direction.

The lower rate is the only choice that stays right however the two fall: sell everything through the
better channel and the pack arrives early, which is the right way for a minimum to be wrong. The
screens name which rate was used and what beating it looks like, so it never reads as an arbitrary
figure.

Deriving it from an assumed channel mix would be a guess dressed as arithmetic, and deriving it from
the actual mix would move the goal every time somebody sold something — the circularity §3.2 already
refuses elsewhere.

**Actuals live in a separate ledger.** Per the [unit budgeting guidelines](https://lhcscouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unit-budgeting-guidelines.pdf),
the treasurer must *"enter all income and expenditures **under the proper budget item** in the
finance section of the Pack Record Book"* and *"check all disbursements **against budget
allowances**."* Two records: a plan, and transactions posted against it.

**Two principles that shape the design:**

- *"Plan to pay for everything… even if you don't end up paying for all of them. Your budget
  should reflect the **true cost** of Scouting."* → Planned is deliberately generous. Variance is
  normal and expected; the app should present it, not hide it.
- *"A Scout pays his own way"* means **plan on raising the money**, not billing families per
  event. Per-event family billing is a real thing packs do, but it is the exception in the
  official model — so it belongs in its own subsystem, not woven through the budget.

**Scout accounts have a legal boundary.** Per-scout fundraising credit is a Scout Account, subject
to IRS direct-benefit limits — commonly 60/40 with the majority of *net* proceeds to the unit, and
[never a payment to a Scout or family](https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2014/12/03/individual-scout-accounts/).
Our reward tiers cover *pack charges*, which is on the right side of that line, but the boundary
should be visible in the model.

## 3. The proposed model — four records

```
EVENT            what the pack is doing        (Program)
  ↓ referenced by
BUDGET LINE      what we plan it to cost       (Money · Budget)
  ↓ posted against by
LEDGER ENTRY     what actually moved           (Money · Ledger)          ← new
  ↓ charges raised onto
FAMILY ACCOUNT   what each family owes/paid    (Money · Dues & fees)     ← reworked
```

### 3.1 Event — `state.events[]`

Pure calendar. No money.

```js
{ id, kind: 'pack'|'den'|'activity'|'storefront', den, name, dens,
  date, time, endTime, location, note, slot, sourceUid }
```

Absorbs today's `meetings[]` and the calendar half of `budget.activities[]`. `sourceUid`
round-trips ICS. RSVP and attendance key off `event.id` — one mechanism instead of today's split
between `attendance[meetingId]` (meetings only) and `rsvps['act:'+id]` (activities only).

#### Who an event is for

`dens` is the list of dens an **activity** is for. Empty — the default, and what every existing
event migrates to — means the whole pack, which is most of what a pack does. Webelos Woods and
Tiger Mania are the exceptions that need it, and they are not a display nicety: planning a
four-scout event against a ten-scout roster overstates the plan, and **charging ten families for
an event six of them were not invited to is a real error, not a rounding one.**

It lives on the event, not on the budget line, because who is invited decides three things at
once — who is asked to RSVP, who is on the attendance list, and who is billed. One field, read
in three places, exactly as the date is. The budget line reads it through its event
(`lineDens` → `eventForLine`), so `linePlanned` and the expected-fee income narrow with it. A
line with no event — dues, registration — is the whole roster by definition.

A `kind: 'den'` meeting already names its den in `den` and a pack meeting is everyone, so `dens`
is cleared on those kinds rather than left to contradict the kind. A scout with **no den set** is
in no den's event; the UI says so out loud, because the alternative is a family that quietly never
gets billed.

#### Attendance is a head count, not a tick

A scout does not arrive alone, and does not arrive with a predictable number of people. Both
parents often come; siblings usually do. So attendance per family is a small count, not a boolean:

```js
state.attendance[eventId][scoutId] = { scout: 0|1, adults: 0..n, siblings: 0..n }
```

Today's meeting attendance (`{ scoutId: true }`) migrates to `{ scout: 1, adults: 0, siblings: 0 }`
and keeps working unchanged — for a den meeting, heads other than the scout cost nothing and the
extra fields simply stay zero.

This one record does three jobs: who was there (program), how many heads to cost (budget), and
what to charge which family (accounts).

### 3.2 Budget line — `state.budget.lines[]`

The plan. Mirrors 510-278, with one addition this pack needs: a pack event is priced **per head**,
and the heads are not all the same kind or price.

```js
{ id, category,                  // 'registration'|'charter'|'advancement'|'recognition'
                                 // |'events'|'activities'|'camp'|'materials'|'training'
                                 // |'uniforms'|'reserve'|'other'|'income'
  name,
  basis: 'per-head'|'per-family'|'flat',
  scoutRateCents,                // per scout            — PLANNED and CHARGED
  includeLeaders,                // does the pack pay for leaders on this line?

```

#### The pack covers scouts and leaders. Nobody else.

*Owner ruling, 2026-07-27.* Parents and siblings pay their own way, so **they must never appear in
the pack's planned figure.** The plan counts two head counts, and both are numbers the pack already
keeps — the scout roster and the registered-leader roster — so neither is a guess:

```js
plannedHeads = { scouts: activeScouts, leaders: includeLeaders ? activeLeaders : 0 }
planned      = scoutRate × scouts + leaderRate × leaders
```

This replaced `adultsFrom: 'assumption'` + `adultsPerScout` (default 1), which invented one parent
per scout and multiplied them by the adult rate. A per-head line with any adult rate at all planned
to pay for ten parents the pack was never going to pay for — the single biggest way this app could
overstate what a pack has to raise. Migration moves a per-registered-leader fee onto
`leaderRateCents` unchanged (the seeded adult registration line), and leaves a family rate where it
is while dropping it out of the plan: **planned figures on those lines fall, and that is the
correction.**

Leaders carry their own rate rather than sharing the scout's because registration is genuinely two
prices — $85 youth, $65 adult. A campsite or a plate of food is one price, so ticking the box
starts the leader rate at the scout rate.

`adultRateCents` and `siblingRateCents` survive as **billing** rates: what a family owes for the
heads it brings, raised as charges from recorded attendance (§3.4's worked example is unchanged) and
asked for only where families are billed through the pack. Planning assumes; reality is entered
afterwards — and a parent is reality, not an assumption.

#### Two questions, two fields

The old `familyPays` boolean could not express a council camp at all. The obvious fix — a third
value, `'council'` — reads backwards: it sounds like the council is *paying for* the camp, when in
fact the council is the one *being paid*. That was a symptom, not a wording problem. **One field
was being asked two independent questions**, which is the same mistake this whole document is
about:

1. **Whose money is it, in the end?** → `fundedBy`
2. **Does it pass through the pack's bank account?** → `paidDirectTo`

Separated, both read correctly and three real arrangements fall out:

```
fundedBy: 'pack'         paidDirectTo: ''
    vendor  ←──────────  PACK
    One ledger entry, OUT. Nobody is billed.
    This is what fundraising exists to cover.

fundedBy: 'families'     paidDirectTo: ''
    vendor  ←──────────  PACK  ←────────  families
    Ledger OUT to the vendor, then ledger IN per family.
    The pack fronts the money and is made whole. Net cost ≈ 0,
    except what it waives or forgives.

fundedBy: 'families'     paidDirectTo: 'Council'
    Council  ←─────────────────────────  families
    NO ledger entries. The pack is not in this transaction at all.
```

| | Pack fronts it? | Families billed by us? | Touches our balance? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pack | yes | no | yes — an expense | charter fee, awards, program materials |
| families, through us | yes | yes | yes — out, then back in | Blue & Gold, campout, dues |
| families, direct | **no** | **no** | **no** | day camp, resident camp |

The useful reading: **`fundedBy: 'pack'` is what popcorn has to cover.** Anything `families` is
theirs either way — `paidDirectTo` only says whether we are the ones handling it.

**`paidDirectTo` holds a name, not a flag**, which makes it both clearer and more general. Council
camps are the common case, but so are uniforms: 510-278 budgets *"every Cub Scout in full
uniform"*, and most packs have families buy those from the Scout Shop themselves. Same
arrangement, different payee, no new concept:

```
Cub day camp      fundedBy: families   paidDirectTo: 'Council'
Full uniforms     fundedBy: families   paidDirectTo: 'Scout Shop'
```

These lines exist so the committee can see the true cost of a year to a family, and so the event
still appears on the calendar — but that money is never the pack's and must never move the pack's
balance. Today's model cannot say this, so those costs either sit in the budget and overstate what
the pack spends, or get dropped and understate what Scouting costs a family.

`fundedBy: 'pack'` with a `paidDirectTo` is meaningless — if the pack is paying, it goes through
the pack's account — and the UI should not offer the combination.

#### Two fields, but one question to answer

Two independent fields is right for the *model* and was wrong for the *control*. Shipped as two
controls, the commonest arrangement in this pack — families pay the council for day camp — was
reachable only by picking "Families pay" and then noticing a text box appear underneath it.
Nobody found it, and a council camp sat in the budget as money the pack was expected to raise.

So **one select names all three arrangements**:

| Control | `fundedBy` | `paidDirectTo` |
|---|---|---|
| Pack pays | `pack` | `''` |
| Families pay the pack | `families` | `''` |
| Families pay Council direct | `families` | `'Council'`, prefilled and editable |

The third option is not a third `fundedBy` value — that is still the wrong answer for the reason
above. It sets both fields, filling in the payee every pack means by it, and the payee stays a
name because uniforms go to the Scout Shop and a campground bills its own. Clearing the name puts
the line back through the pack's books, which is what a blank payee has always meant.

#### Planning assumes; reality is entered afterwards

Parents are not going to RSVP in this app, at least not yet. So the plan cannot wait on them — and
**it no longer has to guess at them either.** The plan counts the two rosters the pack keeps (see
*The pack covers scouts and leaders*, above):

```js
plannedHeads = { scouts: activeScouts, leaders: includeLeaders ? activeLeaders : 0 }
planned      = scoutRate × scouts + leaderRate × leaders
```

Nothing here pretends to know who is coming, because it does not have to: nobody outside those two
rosters is the pack's money.

> **Superseded, 2026-07-27.** This section used to read "the planning head count is an assumption,
> stated openly" — one adult per scout, editable per line. Openly stated or not, it was still the
> pack budgeting to pay for parents who pay for themselves, and every per-head line with an adult
> rate carried it. What a family owes for the heads it brings is now raised from recorded
> attendance only.

**After the event, the Treasurer enters what actually happened** — the attendance head counts and
the real amount spent (as a ledger entry). From that point the line reports:

| | Source |
|---|---|
| **Planned** | scout roster × scout rate (+ leader roster × leader rate) — the number the committee agreed |
| **Expected heads** | those same two rosters |
| **Actual heads** | entered attendance, including the parents and siblings who came |
| **Actual cost** | Σ ledger entries on the line — what was really paid |
| **Charged** | rates × actual heads, per family, scout share waived where a tier applies |

Which is exactly the case that started this: *estimate $40 × 10 scouts, actual $42, but only six
turned up.* Planned stays $400 because that is what was budgeted; actual is whatever the ledger
says was paid; charges are raised against six families, not ten. Three different numbers, three
different records, none of them fighting.

**Planned never moves on its own** — that is the point of a plan. `actualCents` is *gone*; actual
is derived from the ledger.

### 3.3 Ledger entry — `state.ledger[]` *(new)*

What actually moved. This is the record that makes the app reconcilable.

```js
{ id, date, description,
  amountCents,                   // always positive
  direction: 'in'|'out',
  lineId,                        // which budget line it posts against ('' = uncategorised)
  method: 'check'|'cash'|'card'|'transfer'|'',
  ref,                           // check number / receipt
  scoutId,                       // set when it settles a charge
  source,                        // 'family'|'donation'|'fundraiser'|'commission'|'carryover'|''
  donor }                        // who gave it, when source === 'donation'
```

`source` is what lets income be read correctly. Two $80 entries that both settle Ben's dues are
very different events if one came from Ben's family and the other from the chartered organisation,
and the pack should be able to see and thank the second.

Then:

- **Actual for a line** = `Σ ledger where lineId = line.id`
- **Balance** = `startingBalance + Σ in − Σ out` — a real cash position that can be compared to a
  bank statement, which is the whole point
- **Budget vs actual** = per line, per category, and in total — with variance

Popcorn commission, cash donations and other fundraisers become *ledger entries* (posted to
income lines) rather than figures the budget recomputes from three other subsystems. The Popcorn
workspace still computes what it's owed; the Kernel or Treasurer posts it once, on the day the
council cheque clears — which is when it's actually true.

### 3.4 Family account — `state.charges[]` and payments in the ledger

A `fundedBy: 'families'` line raises charges **from the recorded attendance head counts** — one per
head, because that is how the cost is actually incurred.

```js
charge = { id, scoutId, lineId, who: 'scout'|'adult'|'sibling',
           amountCents, date,
           waivedBy,                            // reward tier id — earned
           forgiven }                           // { date, by, reason } — granted
```

A family that brought the scout, both parents and a younger sibling gets four charges against that
scout's account: one `scout`, two `adult`, one `sibling`.

#### Four ways a charge is settled, and they are not interchangeable

A charge stops being outstanding four different ways. Collapsing any of them into "paid" or
"written off" would misstate the pack's position:

| Settled by | Money arrives? | Pack out of pocket? | Record |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Family pays** | yes, from the family | no | ledger `in`, `source: 'family'` |
| **Donation covers it** | **yes, from a third party** | **no** | ledger `in`, `source: 'donation'`, `donor` |
| **Waived** — scout reached a tier | no | yes, from fundraising | `charge.waivedBy = tierId` |
| **Forgiven** — committee granted it | no | yes, deliberately | `charge.forgiven = {date, by, reason}` |

The middle two look identical on a family's statement — *"you owe nothing"* — and are completely
different to the pack. **A donation leaves the pack whole; a waiver or forgiveness does not.**

- *Total waived* is what fundraising bought the families. It is the number that keeps the Scout
  Account boundary visible.
- *Total forgiven* is what the pack chose to absorb. A committee should see that deliberately, not
  discover it as a gap at year end.
- *Total donated* is what somebody else paid for, and it is **good news** — it should be visible,
  attributable, and thankable, not buried in the same bucket as a write-off.

**None of them delete the charge.** It was raised, it stands, and it carries a reason. An auditor
can read a marked charge; a missing one tells them nothing.

Forgiveness in particular is the practice the sample financial bylaws assume — the Treasurer is
told to *"sympathetically counsel with a family which may be financially unable to pay fees"* and
that *"no boy should be left out of activities due to inability to pay."* It is expected. It just
has to leave a trace.

Outstanding for a family = `Σ charges where !waivedBy && !forgiven` − `Σ payments (any source)`.

#### Donations — designated and pooled

Two patterns, and the app should handle both:

**Designated** — the chartered org covers Ben's camp fee specifically. One ledger entry does it:

```
IN  $80.00  "St Mark's — camp assistance for Ben"   line: Camp   scoutId: s1
            source: 'donation'   donor: "St Mark's Church"
```

That settles Ben's charge exactly as a family payment would, but is attributable to the donor.

**Pooled** — the chartered org gives $500 toward "whoever needs help". That is income to a
scholarship line, drawn down later per scout. Conveniently, 510-278 already has the line for it:
**Reserve fund (11) — registration scholarships**. Money in when it arrives; each later use is a
payment against a charge, tagged to that line, so the remaining balance is always visible.

> **Two compliance notes worth carrying in the UI, not just here.** Units *"are not permitted to
> solicit contributions for unit programs"* — accepting an offered gift is fine, asking is not.
> And *"gifts to units are almost never tax deductible"*, so the app must never generate anything
> that looks like a deductible-donation receipt. Recording a donor for a thank-you is the right
> amount of ceremony.

**This pack's rule, expressed exactly:**

> Until a scout reaches a fundraising tier, the family covers **the scout and everyone they bring**.
> Once the tier is reached, the family covers **only the people they bring** — the scout's own
> share is paid from fundraising.

So a reward tier waives **`who: 'scout'` charges** by default. Adults and siblings stand — a
scout's fundraising buys the scout's seat, not the family's.

#### A tier covers a SHARE of a line, not the line

*Owner ask, 2026-07-27.* "One lower tier where we provide a pack shirt for the scout, then another
higher reward where we provide an adult pack shirt." One budget line, two prices, two rewards — and
the default above made the second one unsayable.

A cover entry is therefore the collect key with an optional head kind after a `#`. A **bare key is
the scout share**, which is what every existing tier means, so nothing migrates:

```
'L-shirt'          the scout's shirt   scoutRateCents
'L-shirt#adult'    an adult's shirt    adultRateCents
```

```js
waived = coveredShares[coverKey(line, charge.who)][charge.scoutId]
```

The scout-only rule becomes a **default rather than a prohibition**. What kept it honest was that
nobody could quietly bill fundraising for a parent's seat; what keeps it honest now is that naming
an adult share is deliberate, per tier, and **costs the plan real money** the moment it is named:

| Covered share | Already in A? | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| scout | yes — `planned = scoutRate × scouts` | **B falls**: fees the plan stops expecting |
| adult / sibling | **no** — those rates bill a family, they are never planned | **A rises**: the pack is buying something outright |

Getting that second row wrong would put the cost nowhere at all, so `coverCostForKeys` returns the
two apart and the worksheet prints *"…of which reward tiers buy for adults or siblings"* under A.

**This is not a shirt feature.** The split is offered on every line a family is billed for, and on
every arrangement — the pack collecting it *or* the council. It was originally asked for only where
the pack collects, which quietly made it a property of shirts and dinners: a council-paid campout
had nowhere to put an adult price, so no tier could ever cover an adult's place at one. A line with
no adult price yet says what setting one would buy: something separate for a higher tier to cover.

#### One price for the whole family — `basis: 'per-family'`

Council camping is priced **per family**: one fee, whoever they bring. That is not a per-head line
with the adult rate left blank — it is a line where *there are no separate heads to price*, and
saying so is what stops a tier being pointed at an adult share that does not exist.

`per-family` is a per-head line with exactly one head, so it inherits all the same math (one charge
per scout, `planned = rate × roster`) and nothing downstream learns a third shape. What changes is
what the editor asks for — one figure, no leader box, no adult or sibling price — and that the
picker offers the whole fee as a single thing to cover.

#### Families — `scout.familyId`

*Owner ask, 2026-07-27, closing the limit above.* A per-family fee counted once per **scout** was
one too many for every pair of siblings in the pack. The fix is one field:

```js
familyKeyOf(s) = s.familyId || s.id      // no link = a family of one
```

Deliberately not a family *entity*: nothing to create, name, rename or leave orphaned, and a pack
that links nobody behaves exactly as it did. Linking Ben to Ada sets Ben's `familyId` to Ada's key,
so linking a third to either of them joins the same family. `normalizeState` never resolves it — a
link to a scout who left simply stops matching anybody, and they are a family of one again.

**It changes exactly one thing.** `lineBillingRoster(l)` is the line's own roster, narrowed again to
one scout per family *only when the line is priced per family*; everything else bills every scout it
applies to. So:

| | Per-family fee | Everything per head |
|---|---|---|
| Counted | once per family | once per scout |
| Charged to | the first of them on the roster | each scout |
| A parent's place | — (no separate heads) | **one per scout, unchanged** |

> **Owner rule, stated because it is the thing that would be wrong to assume:** *"if a family has
> two scouts, each scout is allowed a parent, so both parents are still eligible."* Linking pools
> the family fee and **nothing else**. `collapseMarkedToFamilies` moves only the scout mark onto the
> billing scout; adult and sibling heads stay recorded against the scout they were recorded against,
> so two scouts keep two scouts' worth of entitlement everywhere it matters.

Verified end to end: linking two of four scouts took a $75 per-family council fee from **$300 to
$225** and a pack-collected $50 per-family fee from four charges to **three** — while $80 per-head
dues stayed at **four charges of $80**, one for each scout including the linked sibling.

**Tiers stack, so a higher tier names only what it ADDS.** The adult-shirt tier covers
`L-shirt#adult` alone — the scout's shirt already came from the tier below — which is exactly what
makes the per-tier margin figure meaningful:

```
"Adult shirt" $220 earned — $70 more a scout than the tier below ($233.34 of sales),
                            against $18 of cover → pays for itself
```

#### A threshold is COMMISSION, not sales

*Owner ruling, 2026-08-02, replacing the sales basis below.* A threshold is **what the scout earned
the pack**. "Reach $150" means $150 landed in the pack's account.

The reason is that the other half of a tier — what it hands back — is priced in real dollars. On a
sales basis the two sides were in different currencies and every screen had to convert between them.
On a commission basis they are the same currency, and three things collapse into subtraction:

| | Sales basis (until 2026-08-02) | Commission basis |
|---|---|---|
| Does the tier pay for itself? | sales × rate vs cover | **threshold − cover** |
| What a stretch level earns at the margin | gap × rate | **the gap** |
| The make-up payment for a missed deadline | the **sales** gap — a $50 gap on $15 of lost commission | **the commission the pack didn't get** |

That last row was a real over-charge: a family closing a $50 shortfall handed over $50 to replace
$15 the pack would have earned. It is now exactly whole.

**Earned at each channel's own rate** (`scoutCommissionOf`) — online money at the online rate,
everything else at the base rate, rounded per channel, the same split `computePackTotals` uses. The
consequence is deliberate and worth saying out loud: *two scouts with identical sales can land either
side of a tier* if one sold online and the other at a storefront. That is the thing being measured.

**What a scout can act on is still sales**, so every tier prints both (`salesForCommission`):

```
Reaching it means the scout has earned the pack $150.00, against $146.00 handed back.
  [pays for itself]  A scout gets there on $500.00 of sales + online donations
                     — or less, if they sell where the pack earns the better 35%.
```

The sales figure is a **floor, not an estimate**: worked out at `commissionRates().goal` (the lower
of the two rates, the same one the goal uses) and rounded **up**. Sell that much down any channel and
the tier is reached; sell it at the better rate and it is reached sooner. Quoting the storefront rate
instead would promise Pack 569's $150 tier at $428.58 and then fail to deliver it to a scout who sold
online — the one direction a minimum must never be wrong in.

> **No rate, no measurement.** A threshold in commission is unmeasurable until a commission rate is
> set, so nobody earns anything and the card says so rather than showing every tier at nought scouts.
> Note that "does it pay for itself" still answers without a rate — only the sales line needs one.

> **No migration.** Stored thresholds are numerically unchanged: they were entered meaning "what the
> pack hands back", which is a commission figure. Anyone who had typed a *sales* number would find
> their tiers roughly three times harder, which is why every tier now prints its sales equivalent on
> screen where it can be eyeballed.

#### Reimbursing a fee the family paid the council

*Owner ask, 2026-07-27.* Spring and fall camping: parents register with the council and pay it
directly, so the pack is not in the transaction (`paidDirectTo`). The pack still wants a tier that
gives that money back. [Scouting America's Unit Budgeting Guidelines](https://lhcscouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unit-budgeting-guidelines.pdf)
set the shape this has to take:

> "At no point can a unit 'Pay' a Scout, leader or family. **Expenses can be reimbursed** (according
> to individual unit bylaws), and money can be transferred to another unit, but **don't write a
> check to a Scout or their family**."
>
> "Scout account funds can only be used for Scouting activities and costs — **payouts to Scouts or
> families are NOT ALLOWED**."
>
> "To avoid 'Direct Benefit' — **the majority of the NET PROCEEDS** of a fundraiser have to go to
> the unit, not individual Scouts."

Those are not in conflict: reimbursing a **documented Scouting expense against a receipt** is
expressly allowed; handing a family a share of what their scout sold is not. The two can look
identical in a bank statement, so only the record tells them apart — which makes this a records
problem, and the app's job:

- a family-direct line is offerable to a tier, labelled **reimburse**;
- it can never be "fees the plan stops expecting" (the pack never collected them), so it is always
  **spending** — it lands in the same `extra` bucket as an adult share and enters A;
- settling one writes a ledger entry **out**, against the line, **carrying the scout**, described as
  a reimbursement, with a prompt to put the council receipt number on it;
- the card says the cleaner arrangement out loud: **have the pack register and pay the council for
  those scouts** and set the line to *pack pays* — then no money goes to a family at all.

**A paid-direct line is out of the PLAN but not out of the BOOK.** `computeBudget` used to skip
those lines for planned *and* actual; a reimbursement is real money leaving the pack's account, so
actual now counts ledger entries on them. Planned excluded, actual counted — they were never the
same question, and the balance was wrong by exactly what had been paid back.

Finally, `privateBenefitCheck()` runs the guidance's own test on the pack's own numbers — what the
tiers have handed to individuals against the commission earned — and says which side of "the
majority stays with the unit" the pack is on. Not advice: a number, and the sentence it came from.

#### Covering the leaders, and paying for it out of popcorn

*Owner question, 2026-07-28: "if we wanted to cover leaders for activities/dues/etc, but split
those costs amongst each scout to cover those costs through fundraisers, how would I budget for
that?"*

The mechanism already existed and the plan already splits it — tick **include registered leaders**
on the line and set the per-leader rate. What was missing is that the split was **wrong by exactly
the leaders' cost**, and nothing on screen said what covering them came to.

**The bug.** Expected family income falls back to the planning figure on a line with no charges
raised yet (an event before anybody has attended). That figure was `linePlanned`, which includes
the leaders' places — so a pack covering its leaders was told that families would hand over the
leaders' money too, and its fundraising need came out short by that amount. Worked example, two
scouts and two leaders at $40 each:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| A — what the pack spends | $160 | $160 |
| B — what families are billed | $160 ✗ | **$80** |
| C — what popcorn must raise | $80 ✗ | **$160** |

Fixed with `lineFamilyPlanned(l)` — the scout share and nothing else — used wherever the question
is *"what would families be billed?"*. `linePlanned` is still the whole cost, because that is what
the pack really plans to spend, and A is still right. The two were never the same question.

**And the answer to the question is now a number on the worksheet:**

```
A  Total budgeted program expenses                                    $480.00
   …of which leaders' places the pack covers  ($120.00 a scout on the goal)  $240.00
```

That is the whole of "split it amongst the scouts": a leader's place is never billed to a family,
so it stays in A, C rises by it, the goal rises by it ÷ commission, and every scout's per-scout
goal already carries their share. The line just makes it visible enough to decide on.

#### A scout's credit on cash the pack keeps — `cashScoutPct`

*Owner ask, 2026-08-02: "If [cash is not run through Trail's End], I want to be able to split the
cash donations so a set commission goes to each scout who earned it and the rest goes to fund the
pack."*

A tier threshold is **commission** — what the scout put in the pack's account. That reading breaks
on a cash donation the pack keeps whole, because a kept donation generates no commission at all. A
scout who brought $500 in cash to a storefront table sat at **$0 earned**, while one who rang up
$500 of product moved $175 up the board. The money was better for the pack and worth nothing to
the scout.

`cashScoutPct` is the third rate, and the only one that isn't Trail's End's:

| Channel | Rate | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| Online | `commissionPctOnline` | commission — pack income |
| Storefront / wagon | `commissionPct` | commission — pack income |
| **Cash the pack keeps** | **`cashScoutPct`** | **tier credit only — the cash was already 100% income** |

**It is credit, not a payout.** Nothing is handed to a scout and no scout has an account. Scouting
America's unit budgeting guidance is plain that money raised in the pack's name belongs to the
pack, and crediting individual accounts by individual sales is the private-benefit problem the
guidance exists to prevent. This rate decides tier progress and nothing else — the same thing
popcorn commission already does here. That is also the honest reading of "the rest goes to fund the
pack": the pack banks every cent either way, and the rate only decides how much of a donation a
reward tier has a claim on. $700 kept at 30% is $150 spoken for and $550 nothing is owed against.

**Two traps, both closed:**

1. **Double counting.** With the Trail's End toggle ON that same cash is already inside
   `goalBaseOf` and has earned real commission. So `commissionRates().cash` is the **effective**
   rate — null whenever the toggle is on — and `cashScoutCredit()` returns 0. A $500 donation
   earns 17,500¢ with the toggle on, not 32,500¢.
2. **Crediting money nobody brought in.** `cashCreditTotals()` sums the credit **per scout**, so
   cash sitting on a storefront block with no scouts assigned is never credited to anyone. It
   stays in the free figure, which is where it belongs.

The credit does move the budget, and correctly: scouts reaching tiers on donations means the pack
covers more of their fees, so B falls and C rises. The donation is in the bank and the reward it
buys is out of it.

`tierRateMissing()` counts this rate too — a pack running a donations-only drive can measure tiers
on it alone.

#### Which tier the pack plans on — `planOnTierId`

*Owner ask, 2026-07-27.* A waiver is a fact about sales that have happened, so in July it covers
nobody, and the plan expects every family to pay every fee. A pack that intends popcorn to pick
those fees up is then **planning the wrong year**: it counts income it means to give away, and its
sales goal comes out low by exactly the amount it promised.

> **Revised the same day.** The first cut was one switch — *"plan as if every scout earns their
> tier"* — which in practice meant assuming everyone reached the **top** one. Pack 569's top tier is
> $350 a scout covering $3,614 of fees, and the check duly reported **short by $2,021.50**: correct,
> and useless. Assuming the best case is not a plan.

So the pack names **one tier as the level it plans on**. Coverage stacks, so planning on tier 2
plans on tiers 1 and 2; everything above is a **stretch**.

|  | Planned tier and below | Stretch tiers |
|---|---|---|
| Honoured when a scout earns it | yes | **yes** |
| In the budget | yes | **no** |
| Effect on the goal | raises it by what the pack picks up | none |

`planOnTierId` is `''` by default, so no pack record's goal moves until somebody chooses. Choosing
moves it **up** only, because the deduction is floored against what is actually owed
(`mine = Math.min(mine, owed)`), and a charge already waived left `fees` when it was waived and is
not taken off a second time.

**Both halves are checkable, and they are different questions.** For the planned tier: everybody
reaching it is a known quantity of **commission**, so it either pays for what was promised or does
not. Since 2026-08-02 that comparison needs no rate at all — the rate only says what the promise is
in popcorn —

```
all 13 scouts reach "Pack shirt" ($100 earned each) → the pack has earned $1,300
                                        → against $1,196 of fees it picks up
                                        → clears it, $104 to spare
                                        → which takes $4,333.34 of sales at 30%
```

For a stretch tier the question is at the **margin**, because it happens one scout at a time: going
from the tier below to this one earns the pack the **gap**, and the gap is what has to cover the
extra fees that level picks up —

```
"Adult Activites" $250 earned — $50 more a scout ($166.67 of sales), against $60 of cover
                              → costs the pack $10 a scout who gets there
```

That is the number a pack wants before it writes a big reward on a poster, and it is invisible in any
whole-pack average. Shown both ways round — *pays for itself* / *costs $X a scout* — because a
promise the thresholds cannot fund should be found in July, not in February.

The worksheet prints the fees row **gross** and the deduction beneath it so the column still adds up
to B.

#### A deadline on a tier — `dueBy`

*Owner ruling, 2026-07-27: "a hard deadline, where they either have to hit goal target by the date
or pay the difference to hit the tier."*

Dues are due on a date. If a tier covers them, the tier has to close on that date too, or the pack
never knows what it is owed. So a tier may carry a `dueBy`, and then:

- It is measured on **sales dated on or before that date**, always — not only after it passes. A
  sale on the 2nd cannot satisfy a deadline of the 1st, and saying so up front beats moving the
  line later. (`computeScoutTotals(asOf)`. A record with **no** date still counts: there is nothing
  to judge it by, and dropping a scout's sale over a blank field would take money off them for a
  clerical gap.)
- Once the date has passed the tier is **closed**. Whoever did not reach it is billed the fee it
  would have covered — which needs no new mechanics at all, because an unwaived charge is the
  default state.
- Or they **pay the difference**: the gap between what they **earned the pack** and the threshold,
  **capped at the fee the tier covers**. Paying more to reach a tier than the tier saves you is not a
  rule anybody means, so the cap is part of the rule rather than a kindness. Since the threshold
  became a commission figure (2026-08-02) that gap is the money the pack actually missed, so paying
  it leaves the books exactly where the selling would have; the row also shows the same gap in sales,
  for the family that would rather hear it in popcorn.

Recording a makeup writes **two different kinds of thing**, deliberately: the money goes in the
**ledger** as an ordinary family payment (it really arrived; it has to reconcile), and the fact that
the tier is satisfied goes on the **tier** as `madeUp`. From there the normal waiver machinery
covers the fee. Undoing it removes only the pack's decision — the payment stays, because deleting
somebody's money to correct a tick would be the worse bug.

One consequence worth stating: *total waived* now includes fees bought by a makeup payment as well
as by fundraising. The ledger entry names which, so the Scout Account boundary stays measurable.

**Who earned what is computed once**, deadline-aware, and read by coverage, the waivers, the
standings badges and the deadline report (`tierEarnedMap`). Four screens disagreeing about whether
a scout made a tier is the failure mode this shape exists to prevent.

**Where this sits relative to the two models Scouting America describes.** The unit budgeting
guidelines offer a choice:

- **Full funding** — *"all money goes to the unit and all activities are paid for all Scouts,"*
  with fundraising incentivised only by prize programs. What a family pays is unrelated to what
  their scout sold, so there is nothing to stop free-riding.
- **Scout Accounts** — a share of **net** proceeds credited to the individual scout, commonly
  60/40 to the unit. This is the model that carries IRS direct-benefit exposure, which is why the
  guidance caps it by percentage and forbids ever paying a Scout or family.

This pack's rule is a third option and avoids the weakness of each. There are **no individual
account balances**, so there is no direct-benefit surface to manage — but crossing a threshold
buys the scout's own seat, so effort still changes the outcome. Threshold-based rather than
proportional-credit-based.

It also sits comfortably with *"plan on raising the money you need, rather than asking your
families to pay out for each event"*: the family charge is what happens **until** fundraising
covers it, not instead of fundraising. The adult charge remaining is the part that was never a
scout's to earn.

- Payments are ledger entries carrying a `scoutId`.
- **Waived is recorded, not absent.** A waived charge still exists, marked with the tier that
  waived it — so the ledger shows what the pack absorbed, per scout, per event. That is auditable,
  and it makes the Scout Account boundary *measurable*: total waived vs total net proceeds.
- Family balance = `Σ unwaived charges − Σ payments`.

Attendance now lands cleanly: it decides **which charges are raised**, not what the pack spent —
because what the pack spent is whatever the ledger says. And lines with a `paidDirectTo` raise no charges at
all, since that money never passes through the pack.

#### Worked example

Blue & Gold. `scoutRate $15`, `adultRate $15`, `siblingRate $8`. Roster is 10 scouts.

**At planning time** — nobody has RSVP'd and nobody will:

```
plannedHeads  10 scouts + 10 adults (one each, the assumption) + 0 siblings
planned       10 × $15  +  10 × $15                              = $300.00
```

**After the event** — 8 scouts came, 13 adults, 5 siblings. Pack paid the hall $340. Three of the
eight scouts are past the tier.

```
Ledger  OUT   $340.00  Blue & Gold — venue                  → line "Blue & Gold"
Charges       8 scout  @ $15 = $120.00   (3 waived by "Dues covered"  −$45.00)
             13 adult  @ $15 = $195.00
              5 sibling @ $8 =  $40.00
              families owe                                       $310.00
Ledger  IN    $310.00 as families pay (one entry each, scoutId set)

Line result   planned $300 · actual $340 · charged $355 · waived $45
              recovered $310 · pack absorbed $30
```

The pack absorbed $30, and it is worth seeing where that comes from:

```
overspend against plan   $340 − $300  =  +$40
tier waivers                              +$45
extra heads paying           $355 − $300  =  −$55   (26 heads came; 20 were budgeted)
                                          ───────
pack absorbed                              $30
```

Two scouts stayed home but three extra adults and five siblings came, so charging followed 26
heads rather than the 20 assumed and brought in $55 more than the plan — which covered the
overspend and most of the waivers. **None of that is expressible today**, where planned and actual
are the same field multiplied by the roster.

Every number above is a stored record, not a derivation. That is what makes it a book.

### 3.5 Who enters what, and where

The event is where the two halves meet, and they are entered by different people in different
workspaces — which is exactly the split the jobs model already encodes.

| After an event | Who | Where | Record written |
|---|---|---|---|
| Head counts — scouts, adults, siblings | Cubmaster / Activities chair / Den leader | **Program · Calendar**, on the event | `attendance[eventId][scoutId]` |
| …or the same head counts | Treasurer, if nobody else did | **Money · Ledger**, while posting the spend | *the same record* |
| What it actually cost | Treasurer | **Money · Ledger**, posted to the line | ledger entry `out` |
| Charges raised | *automatic* | from head counts × rates | `charges[]` |
| Waiving a scout's share | *automatic* | from the reward tier | `charge.waivedBy` |
| Forgiving a charge | Treasurer / Committee Chair | **Money · Dues & fees** | `charge.forgiven` |
| Recording a family payment | Treasurer | **Money · Ledger** | ledger `in`, `source: 'family'` |
| Recording a donation that covers a scout | Treasurer | **Money · Ledger** | ledger `in`, `source: 'donation'`, `donor` |

Nobody has to be in two places. The person who ran the event says who came; the person with the
chequebook says what it cost. The charges fall out of the two meeting.

That also means **an event is not "closed" until both halves are in**, which is a genuinely useful
thing for Home to nag about — a past event with attendance but no spend, or spend but no
attendance, is an incomplete book and exactly the sort of item the Treasurer's queue should carry.

#### The Treasurer must never be blocked waiting on someone else

The division above is who *should* enter what, not a gate. In a small pack the Cubmaster may
simply not get to it, and the books cannot wait. So **the head count is editable from the ledger
side too**: posting the spend for an event shows its attendance inline, and lets the Treasurer
enter or correct it in the same motion.

If attendance is already recorded, it is shown as recorded — a summary with the counts, not an
empty form — so the Treasurer can see it is done and move on, or correct an obvious error
deliberately rather than silently overwriting somebody's work. **One record, two doors.**

There is one honest limitation to surface rather than hide:

| What is entered | Enough to… | Not enough to… |
|---|---|---|
| **Totals** — "8 scouts, 13 adults, 5 siblings came" | cost the line, compare to plan, close the books | raise family charges |
| **Per family** — the grid | all of the above, **plus** charge each family correctly | — |

For a `fundedBy: 'pack'` line, totals are the whole job and the grid is pointless. For a
`fundedBy: 'families'` line, totals get the accounting right but the app cannot know *whose* $40
it is. It should say exactly that — *"26 heads recorded. Add who came to raise family charges."* —
rather than quietly billing nobody, or worse, guessing.

That is also the graceful degradation path if the Cubmaster never adopts the head-count screen:
the Treasurer alone can keep a completely correct set of books, and only per-family billing needs
the extra detail.

## 3.6 A year in the life

How it actually works once built, in order, with the records each step writes.

### July — the committee plans the year

**Cubmaster and Activities chair** put the calendar together in **Program**. Fourteen events:
den meetings, pack meetings, Fall campout, Blue & Gold, derby, day camp. Each is an **Event** —
date, place, notes. No money anywhere yet.

**Treasurer** opens **Money · Budget** and builds the plan from the 510-278 categories, one line
per thing the pack will pay for. For each line: who pays, and at what rate.

```
Charter fee            flat    $100      fundedBy: pack
Awards & badges        flat    $350      fundedBy: pack
Fall campout           per-head  scout $40 · adult $40 · sibling $20   fundedBy: families  → Event
Blue & Gold            per-head  scout $15 · adult $15 · sibling $8    fundedBy: families  → Event
Cub day camp           per-head  scout $145        fundedBy: families  paidDirectTo: Council  → Event
Pack dues              per-head  scout $80                             fundedBy: families
```

Planned totals use the roster assumption — every active scout, one adult each. Ten scouts:

```
A) Budgeted expenses        $3,150      (paid-direct lines excluded — not the pack's money)
B) Income                     $420      carryover
C) Fundraising need         $2,730   ÷ 32% commission = $8,531 pack popcorn goal
                                                       ÷ 10  =   $853 per scout
```

**That last figure is currently typed in by hand.** After this it is derived from the plan, which
is the entire point of the 510-278 worksheet.

**Popcorn Kernel** sets the reward tiers in **Popcorn · Rewards** — tier 1 at $300 covers Pack
dues; tier 2 at $600 also covers Blue & Gold.

### September — popcorn

Storefronts, shifts, standings, Trail's End imports: **completely unchanged**. The Kernel works
exactly as they do today.

One thing changes at the end. When the council cheque clears, the Treasurer posts **one ledger
entry** rather than the app inferring commission from three subsystems:

```
IN  $2,730.00  "Trail's End commission"  line: Popcorn income  source: 'commission'
```

From that moment the posted figure **replaces** the commission the Budget was working out from
sales — it is not added to it. If the council pays in two cheques, post both; the Budget uses
their total. (Treasurer's audit, 2026-09-27.)

### October — the Fall campout

Planned at $800 (10 scouts + 10 adults × $40). What actually happens:

**After the event, the Cubmaster** opens the Event in **Program** and enters head counts — the
same screen where attendance is already taken, just with numbers instead of ticks:

```
Ben    scout 1 · adults 2 · siblings 1
Ivy    scout 1 · adults 1 · siblings 0
Mae    scout 0 · adults 0 · siblings 0     (didn't go)
…                                          8 scouts · 13 adults · 5 siblings
```

**The Treasurer** pays the campground and posts it in **Money · Ledger**:

```
OUT $1,020.00  "Fall campout — Camp Rainey"  line: Fall campout  method: check  ref: 1043
```

**Charges raise themselves** from the head counts × the rates. Three scouts are past tier 1, so
their **scout** share is waived — their adults and siblings still pay:

```
8 scout   @ $40 = $320   (3 waived by "Dues covered" −$120)
13 adult  @ $40 = $520
5 sibling @ $20 = $100
families owe                                    $820
```

Over the following weeks: seven families pay (ledger `in`, `source: 'family'`), St Mark's covers
one scout's share (ledger `in`, `source: 'donation'`, `donor: "St Mark's Church"`), and one family
is struggling so the Committee Chair forgives $60 with a reason recorded on the charge.

The line now reads:

```
planned $800 · actual $1,020 · charged $940 · waived $120 · forgiven $60 · donated $40
recovered $760 · pack absorbed $260
```

Every one of those is a stored record. **Today none of it exists** — the line would say
`actual $102 × 10 scouts = $1,020` and stop.

### Any month — the Treasurer's routine

Home shows the Treasurer's queue, and it now knows about incomplete books:

- *Fall campout has attendance but no spend recorded* — half a book
- *Blue & Gold has spend but nobody entered who came* — the other half
- *4 families owe $310*
- *12 ledger entries not yet reconciled*

**Reconciling** is a real thing now: open **Money · Ledger · Reconcile**, tick entries against the
bank statement, type the statement's closing balance. The difference should be zero. If it isn't,
something is missing — which is exactly what a treasurer needs to know and cannot currently find
out from this app at all.

At the committee meeting, budget-vs-actual by category, with variance, straight off the plan.

### March — day camp, which is not the pack's money

Day camp is on the calendar. Families pay the council **directly**, $145 a scout —
`fundedBy: 'families'`, `paidDirectTo: 'Council'`.

- It appears in Program like any other event.
- It appears in the true-cost-to-a-family view: *"this year costs your family about $X."*
- It raises **no charge**, writes **no ledger entry**, and does **not move the pack's balance**.

Today there is no way to say that. Either the fee sits in the budget and overstates what the pack
spends, or it is left out and the pack understates what Scouting costs a family.

Uniforms work the same way — `paidDirectTo: 'Scout Shop'` — so 510-278's *"every Cub Scout in full
uniform"* line can finally be budgeted honestly without pretending the pack buys them.

### June — closing the year

Close-out works as it does now, with better inputs:

- The archive stores **real actuals** from the ledger, not `estimate × roster`.
- Carryover is the **reconciled bank balance**, not a derived figure.
- Next year's estimates seed from what things actually cost, which is what the current rollover
  already tries to do — it just finally has true numbers to do it with.

### What the Treasurer can answer afterwards that they cannot today

| Question | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| What is our bank balance? | a derived guess | a reconciled figure, ticked against the statement |
| Are we over budget, and where? | one number per line | per line, per category, with variance |
| Who owes what? | a boolean grid | charges and payments, with dates |
| Why has this not been collected? | *unanswerable* | paid · donated · waived · forgiven, with reasons |
| What did fundraising buy the families? | *unanswerable* | total waived |
| What did we give away? | *unanswerable* | total forgiven |
| What did donors cover, and whom do we thank? | *unanswerable* | total donated, by donor |
| What does Scouting cost one of our families? | *unanswerable* | pack charges + council fees |

## 4. How today's features map on

| Today | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `budget.activities[]` | one Event + one budget line, linked by `eventId` |
| `budget.expenses[]` | budget lines with no `eventId` |
| `activity.actualCents × roster` | Σ ledger entries on that line |
| `collected[key][scoutId] = true` | a charge + a payment ledger entry |
| reward tier `covers[]` | tier threshold waives `who: 'scout'` charges |
| `familyPays` boolean | `fundedBy: 'pack'\|'families'` + `paidDirectTo` |
| camp fees in the pack budget | `paidDirectTo: 'Council'` — visible, outside the books |
| `computeBudget().commission` | an income ledger entry, posted when it lands |
| `meetings[]` + `attendance[]` | Events + attendance keyed on `event.id` |
| storefront `salesCents`/`donationsCents` | unchanged — popcorn keeps its own subsystem |

Popcorn stays as it is. It is a *fundraiser* with its own per-scout credit model; it feeds the
ledger at one seam (commission received, cash deposited) rather than being wired into the budget's
internals.

---

## 5. Migration

Non-negotiable: **`version` stays `1`**, migration is in `normalizeState`, and no ledger is ever
destroyed. There is precedent — `cashInCommission`/`cashInGoal` were migrated and deleted in place.

**Phase 0 — the ledger, and bank reconciliation. ✅ BUILT.** `state.ledger = []` plus
`state.book`, a Money · Ledger section with entry, filtering and a running balance, and a
**reconcile** view: tick entries against a bank statement, enter its closing balance, see the
difference. `computeBudget` was left alone in this phase, so the app kept functioning while the
Treasurer started keeping the real book alongside it.

*This is the load-bearing phase.* Everything after it is about removing the duplicate,
derived version of numbers the ledger already holds.

As built, three details worth carrying forward:

- **The running balance is computed over the whole ledger in date order**, then looked up per
  row — never over the filtered subset, or filtering to "money out" would show a running total
  that never existed.
- **Until an opening figure is set, the headline stat reads "Net movement", not "Bank
  balance".** A freshly migrated book with expenses and no income would otherwise announce a
  large negative bank balance that is not true.
- **The Budget's own Balance is labelled as a projection** wherever a ledger exists, with the
  real cash position shown next to it. The gap between them is information, not an error.

**Phase 1 — derive actual from the ledger. ✅ BUILT.** Every budget line with
`actualCents > 0` was migrated to one ledger entry (date = event date, else today clamped into
the program year; description = line name), and `actualCents` was deleted — its *absence* is
the marker that migration has run, so re-loading never migrates twice. `actual = Σ ledger`.

The migrated amount is the line's **total, not its rate**: `actualCents` on a per-scout line
was multiplied by the roster on every read, so the entry records rate × roster-as-it-stood.
Totals are identical before and after, asserted in `test/harness.mjs`
(*"Phase 1 migration: actual totals are identical before and after"*). From there the figure is
frozen — a transaction does not change when a scout joins the pack.

Two consequences that had to be handled at the same time: the **year rollover** now clears the
ledger, opens the new year's book at the closing bank balance, and divides a per-scout line's
real spend back down by the roster before seeding next year's estimate; and the **append-only
divergence merge** unions `state.ledger`, so two leaders posting receipts from two devices
cannot lose each other's transactions.

**Phase 2 — split events out. ✅ BUILT.** `state.events[]` now holds every meeting and the
calendar half of every activity; `meetings[]` is emptied (not deleted — an older build reading the
record finds an empty calendar rather than a missing key). Budget lines keep their own id, because
the ledger's `lineId` points at it, and gain an `eventId`. The calendar fields are gone from the
budget line entirely.

**The first symptom in §1 is fixed:** importing a BAND calendar creates *events only*. No budget
rows, no money, no per-scout flags. Budgeting an imported event is a deliberate act — a
"+ Budget this" button on the day detail — and an unbudgeted event reads "not budgeted" rather than
silently implying a cost.

Decisions made while building it:

- **Event ids are fresh, and the migration repoints attendance and RSVPs onto them.** Reusing the
  meeting's id would have kept `attendance[meetingId]` working untouched, but left
  `event.id === budgetLine.id` for every migrated activity — two record types aliased in one
  namespace for the life of the app. The repointing is ten lines and is tested directly.
- **RSVP and attendance now key off one id.** `rsvps['mtg:'+id]` and `rsvps['act:'+id]` collapse to
  the bare `event.id`, which is the single mechanism §3.1 asks for. Storefronts are not events, so
  `'sf:'` keys stay prefixed.
- **A budget line's month comes from its event.** `slot` lives on the event, so the Budget's
  month grouping is derived rather than stored twice. Lines whose event was deleted group under
  **"Not on the calendar"** — a state that could not exist before the split, because the date and
  the money were the same row.
- **Deleting a calendar event never deletes the budget line under it.** The ledger posts against
  that line; removing it to service a calendar edit would orphan real transactions. The event goes,
  the money stands, and the Budget says where it went.
- **`meetings[]` is emptied rather than deleted**, and a budget line pointing at a vanished event is
  unlinked rather than left dangling.

**Phase 2b — attendance head counts. ✅ BUILT.** `attendance[eventId][scoutId]` is now
`{ scout, adults, siblings }`; every existing tick migrated to `{ scout: 1, adults: 0, siblings: 0 }`
and keeps working unchanged. Phase 2 had already done the hard half — attendance was keyed on
`event.id` — so this was a value-shape change on a key that no longer had to move.

- **The grid is only asked for where heads cost something.** An activity gets the full
  scout/adults/siblings entry; a den meeting keeps the plain roll-call it has always had, because
  heads other than the scout cost nothing there and a weekly register should stay one tap per scout.
- **A family of zeros is pruned, not stored.** "Absent from the map" has to keep meaning "did not
  come", exactly as the boolean did — otherwise every scout ever unticked would read as a family
  that turned up with nobody in it.
- **A parent who came without their scout is recordable** (`scout: 0, adults: 2`). It happens, and
  from Phase 3 it is chargeable.
- **Roster percentages count scouts, never heads.** The close-out average would otherwise sail past
  100% as soon as the parents were counted.

Still deferred to Phase 3, because it needs `fundedBy` to know which lines care: the Home nag for
*"a past event with attendance but no spend, or spend but no attendance"* (§3.5). Firing it on
every pack-funded line would be noise.

**Phase 3a — pricing, `fundedBy` and `paidDirectTo`. ✅ BUILT.** The `perScout`/`familyPays`
booleans are gone. A line now carries `basis: 'flat'|'per-head'`, the rates,
`includeLeaders`/`leaderRateCents`, `fundedBy: 'pack'|'families'` and `paidDirectTo`. Migration is
total-preserving — a per-scout line's estimate becomes its SCOUT rate with every other rate at zero.
Asserted in `test/harness.mjs`.

- *Amended 2026-07-27:* `adultsPerScout` and `adultsFrom` are gone with them. A per-registered-leader
  fee moved to `leaderRateCents` unchanged; a family adult rate stopped being planned. See *The pack
  covers scouts and leaders* in §3.2 — this is the one migration in the document that deliberately
  MOVES a total, downwards, on the lines that were budgeting for parents.

- **Paid-direct money is out of the books entirely** — excluded from planned, actual, the balance
  and the collect grid — and reported separately as *what the year costs a family*. Before this it
  either sat in the budget and overstated what the pack spends, or was left out and understated
  what Scouting costs a family. `fundedBy: 'pack'` with a payee is not expressible.
- **The paid-direct question is asked once, per pack**, on a dismissible card. Migration never
  guesses it: whether families pay the pack or pay the council is a judgement call per line.
- **Switching basis carries the money across** rather than zeroing it.
- **The rollover carries the pricing shape and rebuilds the calendar.** Phase 2 had left a bug
  here — the re-seeded activity lines had no `eventId`, so the whole plan would have come back
  under "Not on the calendar" with its months lost. Flat lines seed next year from the ledger;
  per-head lines keep their rates, because those are per-person prices and back-deriving them from
  a total that depended on who turned up would be worse than leaving them alone.

*Interim, closed by 3b:* expected family income still counts only the **scout** share of a
per-head line, because `state.collected` can record just one tick per scout. The adult and sibling
shares are real money families owe (the pack fronts it and is made whole) and start counting when
charges replace the collect grid. Until then the figure understates family income, so the popcorn
goal comes out slightly high rather than slightly short.

**Phase 3b — charges and family accounts. ✅ BUILT.** `state.charges[]` holds one charge per
head. All four settlement paths exist and are reported apart. Dues & fees is rebuilt on charges,
and `state.collected` is gone — every tick was backfilled into a ledger payment carrying a
`scoutId`, so no family's history was lost.

- **How charges are raised depends on the line.** A line attached to an EVENT charges whoever
  turned up; a line with no event — dues, registration — charges the roster, because every
  registered scout owes those whether or not they come to anything. Raising dues from attendance
  would have billed nobody.
- **Charges are stored, not derived, and reconciled on `commit()`.** Correcting an attendance typo
  before anyone pays fixes the charge; after they have paid, or once it is waived or forgiven, it
  stands. A book does not lose rows because somebody fixed a head count.
- **A tier waives `who: 'scout'` charges only.** Verified end to end: three scouts past the tier
  had their $15 seat waived ($45, with the tier recorded), and all nine heads they *brought* still
  stood. A scout's fundraising buys the scout's seat, not the family's.
- **A forgiven charge stays on the books** with its reason, who agreed it, and the date.
- **A family payment is income, not a refund.** Backfilled payments carry a `lineId`, and the
  line-actual calculation had to learn that money in with a `scoutId` settles a charge rather than
  reducing what the pack spent — otherwise a dues line reads as negative spending and "actual
  spent" goes below zero. A vendor refund carries no `scoutId` and still reduces the cost.

This also closes the 3a interim: expected family income is now `standing` charges, so the adult and
sibling shares count. And it picks up the Home nag deferred from 2b — a past event that cost money
with no head counts recorded — which needed `fundedBy` to know which lines care about attendance.

The worked example in §3.4 reproduces exactly: 8 scouts, 13 adults and 5 siblings raise 26 charges
totalling **$355.00**.

**Phase 4 — categories and the funding summary. ✅ BUILT.** The 510-278 category list is adopted
whole; existing lines default to `other`, because guessing a category from a free-text name would
be wrong often enough to be worse than asking. Expenses group by category with subtotals, which is
how the worksheet reads and how a committee talks about a budget.

The Budget now shows `A − B = C` as the form actually states it, and **the Trail's End goal is
derived from the plan**. That figure used to be typed in by hand — deriving it is the entire point
of the worksheet. A pack that had already typed a goal keeps it and can switch; the old
"use this as the goal" button, which copied a figure once and then silently went stale, is gone.

- **The summary never reads sales.** The goal feeds `computePackTotals`' `teGoal`, so depending on
  what has been sold would be circular — and the goal would move every time somebody recorded a
  storefront.
- **`computeBudget` and the goal share one arithmetic**, in `fundingSummary()`. Repeating the sum
  is how the Budget card and the goal would drift apart.
- **A family-funded event counts as income before anyone has attended.** Reading only charges would
  treat a family-funded campout as pure cost until the day it happens and inflate the popcorn goal
  by the whole of it — telling the pack to raise money it was never going to spend. Where charges
  exist they are the answer; where they do not, the line falls back to its planning figure. This is
  "plan from an assumption; charge from recorded attendance" applied to the worksheet.
- **Paid-direct money is in neither A nor B**, and an `income`-category line adds to B rather than
  A.

Each phase is shippable and reversible on its own. **Phases 0 and 1 alone make the balance real**
and are worth doing even if the rest waits.

## 6. What deliberately does not change

- Single file, no build step, no dependencies.
- `version: 1`; every change additive in `normalizeState`.
- Popcorn: storefronts, shifts, standings, tiers, inventory, Trail's End import.
- Advancement, derby, roster, jobs, sync, roles, parent view.
- Close-out and archives — though the archive gains real actuals.

## 7. Decisions

**Settled (owner, 2026-07-26):**

1. **The Treasurer keeps the full books in this app.** Not categorised spending — a real ledger
   that reconciles to the bank statement. This raises Phase 0 from "nice register" to the
   foundation everything else sits on.
2. **Families are billed per event, per head** — scout and accompanying parent both.
3. **A fundraising tier waives the scout's share only.** The adult share always stands.
4. **Council events are paid by families directly to council** and never enter the pack's books —
   `fundedBy: 'families'` with `paidDirectTo: 'Council'`. On the calendar, counted in what the
   year costs a family, invisible to the pack's balance.

5. **Plan from an assumption; charge from recorded attendance.** Parents will not be RSVPing here,
   so the plan assumes every active scout plus one adult. After the event the Treasurer enters the
   real head counts and the real spend, and charges are raised from those. *(This was the question
   that started all of this — RSVP is not the answer, because RSVP will not exist.)*
6. **Attendance is an open head count.** A scout may bring two parents and siblings, so attendance
   is `{ scout, adults, siblings }` per family per event, not a tick. Siblings get their own rate.

7. **Attendance is entered on the event, after the fact** — by whoever ran it, in Program. The
   Treasurer separately posts what it cost, in Money. Charges fall out of the two meeting, so an
   event with only one half entered is an incomplete book and should be visible as such.
8. **A charge stands even if the family did not attend, and can be settled four ways** — paid by
   the family, covered by a donation, waived by a reward tier, or forgiven by the committee. All
   four are recorded on the charge or in the ledger, never deleted, and reported separately:
   a donation leaves the pack whole, a waiver or forgiveness does not.

**Settled (owner, 2026-07-26, during the Phase 0/1 build):**

12. **Opening balance and history — both, through one mechanism.** `state.book` holds an
    opening figure and the date it was true. An entry dated **on or after** that date moves the
    bank balance; an entry dated **before** it does not, because the opening figure already
    embodies it. That one rule gives both ways of starting:
    *opening balance* — type today's real bank balance and record forward, and the first
    reconciliation is meaningful immediately; *backfill* — set the date to the start of the
    program year with the balance you had then and enter the season.
    They also mix: a pack can start from today and later backfill September's receipts, which
    will count toward those lines' actual cost **without** double-counting the cash. A
    pre-opening entry is reported on screen rather than hidden, so nobody has to guess why it
    isn't in the balance.

**Still open:**

9. **Scout Account ceiling.** Should the app warn when total tier-waived value gets large relative
   to net fundraising proceeds? No individual balances exist here, so the direct-benefit risk is
   low — but the number is worth seeing.
10. **Categories.** Adopt 510-278's list verbatim, or a shorter pack-specific one?
11. **Who may forgive?** Treasurer alone, or Committee Chair too? The app has jobs now, so this
    can be a real distinction rather than "any editor".
